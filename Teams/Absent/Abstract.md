MORE ADV IN TECH, THE MORE CONVENIENT IT BECOMES
as we become more integrated with tech, we get closer to making science fiction a reality Ex: Girl receives set of robotic arms as promotion for Alita
 
It’s hard to view ourselves objectively without technology these days. Technology has been gradually fused into our daily lives in the past centuries, and now it finally started fusing into our bodies. Example such as Tilly Lockey, known as a British young amputee (who lost her arms from meningococcal septicemia), received a pair of new bionic arms as a promotion for the movie Alita: Battle Angel. Now Tilly Lockey would use her prosthetics arms to do make-up tutorials on Youtube, and she gained lots of fans through what she’s doing. There’s also developing numbers of people who start implanting Tesla key, office key and many other micro technologies into their bodies so that it bring them more convenience in life. It’s interesting to see that how we unconsciously let technology involved in our lives in the past, and now that we consciously chose technology to become a part of our bodies. 
According to Hugh Herr, the new advancement in technology does not only help us to live a better life, but even extend our human experience and capability. “In centuries, there will be no disability in the world.” I totally agree with that. Humans will eventually integrated with technologies, and become one. 

Science fiction and Science Fact has gone hand in hand in the same conversation as which came first, the chicken or the egg. We hold ourselves in a nexcistance that now they are in an ever changing symbiotic relationship where they consistently inspire each other. Items that were once a figmentation of some nerds imagination are now commonplace in our society. So much so that to a point their origins in fantasy have been lost to recent memory and now the item just is. Modern inventions like universal credit cards, touch screen phones, 3D printing and even A.R. and V.R. systems all have origins in Science Fiction and have traversed into reality. These inventions integrante into our lives where their beginnings were once only posted in our imaginations. 

It used to be simple to fake an identity over the Internet and act like you were someone you were not. However, with the development of the digital age people began to publicly broadcast more of their actual life, whether it was through shopping on Amazon, creating playlists on Spotify, getting involved in different Internet subcultures like e-girls or VSCO girls, or streaming themselves on Twitch. William James, a leading thinker of American psychology, proposed in the past that we have as many personalities as the number of situations we are in. When we engage with these different online activities we leave behind digital fragments of our persona. These trails of ones and zeros can converge to create our core personality, a conglomeration of different interests that is not visible from just in-person meetings. And by continuing to live our lives through the Internet, we get closer to becoming one with it.

There is so much we allow our smartphones to do. Upon installing apps like Instagram or Facebook, a permission window appears that requests access to our location, photos, and microphone amongst other things, and we are not given much of a choice if we want to use the app. This is one example, and then there is the smartphone messaging feature—predictive text. Some choose to leave this feature on and let it gather information about us as we type away, such as the words and phrases we often use. By doing so, predictive text becomes more personal, as if building an AI based on the user themselves.
In an interview, Sebastian Schmieg mentioned Ray Kurzweil, who wanted to bring his father back to life. According to Schmieg, “He has archived all of his father’s notes and letters, and they are supposed to form the basis for a reanimation based on AI.” Schmieg took that idea and created a server based on Kurzweil himself, using all the books he had written. In leaving predictive text on, we are almost becoming one with our devices.  

Our integration with technology does not stop there. Self-driving cars are gradually becoming more real. Already, there is a “Navigate on Autopilot” feature in Tesla vehicles that allows a person to set a route, as long as it’s entirely through a highway, and leave the driving to the car. According to Sissi Cao, from The Observer, “Currently, Tesla is trying to enhance this system and make it work for complicated city roads.” Tesla’s director of artificial intelligence, Andrej Karpathy, explained that this would require more computing power than their neural network system could handle. Even then, they are working to make this possible, and we will soon hand over some control to yet another machine.
