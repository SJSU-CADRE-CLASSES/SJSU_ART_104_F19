MORE ADV IN TECH, THE MORE CONVENIENT IT BECOMES
as we become more integrated with tech, we get closer to making science fiction a reality Ex: Girl receives set of robotic arms as promotion for Alita

We settled on the idea that we are becoming, in a way, one with technology. The interview from reading 8 touches on the subject; it talks about how people are taking the place of ai when ai aren’t good enough. 



TOPIC: THE MORE ADV IN TECH WE, THE MORE CONVENIENT IT BECOMES, THE MORE WE INTEGRATE 
•	as we become more integrated with tech, we get closer to making science fiction a reality Ex: Girl receives set of robotic arms as promotion for Alita



Task 1 Shiyao

People become more integrated with new advancements in technology.

Cover the story of Tilly Lockey and tie it into our topic of people becoming more integrated with new advancements in technology. As we integrate advancements in tech into our society, we also integrate areas of that advancement into ourselves. 

'Alita: Battle Angel' filmmakers give new bionic arms to young amputee (exclusive) When she was just 15 months old, Tilly Lockey, from the north of England, fought the battle of her life against meningococcal septicemia.

Abstract: 

It’s hard to view ourselves objectively without technology these days. Technology has been gradually fused into our daily lives in the past centuries, and now it finally started fusing into our bodies. Example such as Tilly Lockey, known as a British young amputee (who lost her arms from meningococcal septicemia), received a pair of new bionic arms as a promotion for the movie Alita: Battle Angel. Now Tilly Lockey would use her prosthetics arms to do make-up tutorials on Youtube, and she gained lots of fans through what she’s doing. There’s also developing numbers of people who start implanting Tesla key, office key and many other micro technologies into their bodies so that it bring them more convenience in life. It’s interesting to see that how we unconsciously let technology involved in our lives in the past, and now that we consciously chose technology to become a part of our bodies. 
According to Hugh Herr, the new advancement in technology does not only help us to live a better life, but even extend our human experience and capability. “In centuries, there will be no disability in the world.” I totally agree with that. Humans will eventually integrated with technologies, and become one.

Task 2 Bryant
From Science Fiction to Science Fact 

Research and develop ideas centered around how Science fiction becomes Science Fact. Reference SciFi in movies, books, or other forms of media to get a reference into what tech started out as SiFi and are becoming commonplace. 

Science fiction writing has inspired everything from underwater travel to massive multiplayer online role-playing games. One author's fanciful imaginings becomes the next generations real-life technology. So here are just a few of the sci-fi books that inspired real world inventions, because science fiction has a real impact on science fact.

Abstract: 

Science fiction and Science Fact has gone hand in hand in the same conversation as which came first, the chicken or the egg. We hold ourselves in a nexcistance that now they are in an ever changing symbiotic relationship where they consistently inspire each other. Items that were once a figmentation of some nerds imagination are now commonplace in our society. So much so that to a point their origins in fantasy have been lost to recent memory and now the item just is. Modern inventions like universal credit cards, touch screen phones, 3D printing and even A.R. and V.R. systems all have origins in Science Fiction and have traversed into reality. These inventions integrante into our lives where their beginnings were once only posted in our imaginations.

Task 3 Jackie
Physical extensions into the digital world 

Reference what extensions we use to reach ourselves onto the digital plane. Question what augmentations, processes, tools, constructs or guides employ to manipulate our digital space. Question how we use these as an extension of ourselves or our own bodies and minds into the digital space. Conclude what implications this could have on the malleability of our physical selves and social constructs into a more digitally connected world. 

 As the technology we have created, over time, has slowly started to replace the need for face-to-face communication, humanity has begun to live with digital technology beyond terms of mere association. We have entered a fixed relationship with it; whereby today, we are represented, judged, assessed and manipulated – by both ourselves and others – online, through the use of multiple platforms on multiple devices.

Abstract:

Internet subcultures are cropping up more frequently than before with the rise of online platforms such as TikTok, especially with the rise of the current e-girl/boy and VSCO girl trends. It brings into question how diverse society will become with the constant creation and development of online personas that are identified through these subcultures, In the present day, the way people act in face-to-face interactions versus over the Internet tend to not match up because they have time to calculate and revise the content they put out compared to the spontaneous reactions needed when talking to someone in person. In the future, however, it is possible that as we become more connected with our digital selves it will be socially acceptable to merge our real life personalities with our Internet ones.

Task 4 Vanessa
Transferring our consciousness into our devices

 Explore what devices and multimedia exchanges we use in reference to making the human experience and personality traits more digital. From your research infer what changes we as a species have undergone because of the development of dynamic learning and mnemonic technology such as A.I. telecommunic devices, and cloud storage.  

Augmented reality in education will soon affect the conventional learning process. AR has the potential to change the location and timing of studying, to introduce new and additional ways and methods. Capabilities of Augmented Reality technology may make classes more engaging and information more apprehendable.  

Abstract:
There is so much we allow our smartphones to do. Upon installing apps like Instagram or Facebook, a permission window appears that requests access to our location, photos, and microphone amongst other things, and we are not given much of a choice if we want to use the app. This is one example, and then there is the smartphone messaging feature—predictive text. Some choose to leave this feature on and let it gather information about us as we type away, such as the words and phrases we often use. By doing so, predictive text becomes more personal, as if building an AI based on the user themselves.
In an interview, Sebastian Schmieg mentioned Ray Kurzweil, who wanted to bring his father back to life. According to Schmieg, “He has archived all of his father’s notes and letters, and they are supposed to form the basis for a reanimation based on AI.” Schmieg took that idea and created a server based on Kurzweil himself, using all the books he had written. In leaving predictive text on, we are almost becoming one with our devices.
