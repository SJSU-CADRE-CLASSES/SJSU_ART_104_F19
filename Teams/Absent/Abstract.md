MORE ADV IN TECH, THE MORE CONVENIENT IT BECOMES
as we become more integrated with tech, we get closer to making science fiction a reality Ex: Girl receives set of robotic arms as promotion for Alita
 
It’s hard to view ourselves objectively without technology these days. Technology has been gradually fused into our daily lives in the past centuries, and now it finally started fusing into our bodies. Example such as Tilly Lockey, known as a British young amputee (who lost her arms from meningococcal septicemia), received a pair of new bionic arms as a promotion for the movie Alita: Battle Angel. Now Tilly Lockey would use her prosthetics arms to do make-up tutorials on Youtube, and she gained lots of fans through what she’s doing. There’s also developing numbers of people who start implanting Tesla key, office key and many other micro technologies into their bodies so that it bring them more convenience in life. It’s interesting to see that how we unconsciously let technology involved in our lives in the past, and now that we consciously chose technology to become a part of our bodies. 
According to Hugh Herr, the new advancement in technology does not only help us to live a better life, but even extend our human experience and capability. “In centuries, there will be no disability in the world.” I totally agree with that. Humans will eventually integrated with technologies, and become one. 

Science fiction and Science Fact has gone hand in hand in the same conversation as which came first, the chicken or the egg. We hold ourselves in a nexcistance that now they are in an ever changing symbiotic relationship where they consistently inspire each other. Items that were once a figmentation of some nerds imagination are now commonplace in our society. So much so that to a point their origins in fantasy have been lost to recent memory and now the item just is. Modern inventions like universal credit cards, touch screen phones, 3D printing and even A.R. and V.R. systems all have origins in Science Fiction and have traversed into reality. These inventions integrante into our lives where their beginnings were once only posted in our imaginations. 

Internet subcultures are cropping up more frequently than before with the rise of online platforms such as TikTok, especially with the rise of the current e-girl/boy and VSCO girl trends. It brings into question how diverse society will become with the constant creation and development of online personas that are identified through these subcultures, In the present day, the way people act in face-to-face interactions versus over the Internet tend to not match up because they have time to calculate and revise the content they put out compared to the spontaneous reactions needed when talking to someone in person. In the future, however, it is possible that as we become more connected with our digital selves it will be socially acceptable to merge our real life personalities with our Internet ones.

There is so much we allow our smartphones to do. Upon installing apps like Instagram or Facebook, a permission window appears that requests access to our location, photos, and microphone amongst other things, and we are not given much of a choice if we want to use the app. This is one example, and then there is the smartphone messaging feature—predictive text. Some choose to leave this feature on and let it gather information about us as we type away, such as the words and phrases we often use. By doing so, predictive text becomes more personal, as if building an AI based on the user themselves.
In an interview, Sebastian Schmieg mentioned Ray Kurzweil, who wanted to bring his father back to life. According to Schmieg, “He has archived all of his father’s notes and letters, and they are supposed to form the basis for a reanimation based on AI.” Schmieg took that idea and created a server based on Kurzweil himself, using all the books he had written. In leaving predictive text on, we are almost becoming one with our devices.
