While social media, ads, surveilance, and a host of other entities are all influencing, often restricting, and fundamentally changing the way that we exist in and interact with the Internet, the companies that provide our very access to it have a uniquely interesting level of control over what we can access online. In the US, these companies have lobbied and perpetuated disinformation campaigns heavily to influence politicians and the public in favor of loosening regulations around content blocking and transparency. While those attempts were somewhat unsuccessful at the time despite heavy public outcry and even opposition from several big tech companies, the most recent head of the FCC has enthusiastically given in to their demands.

This essay will explore the existing and past regulations and the journey to where we are today with telecommunications and their regulations. It will also look at known and potential influences of telecommunications companies on the Internet, as well as potential solutions and alternatives.
