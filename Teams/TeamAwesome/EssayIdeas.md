4) Photography – easier access tool for people, replacement medium for paintings, changes the perspective of a drawing/painting, a canvas itself that’s hard to determine if it’s real or not, exploring people’s perspectives.
	- Learning the perspective of why people modify photos
	- Engaging in a real-time situation, scenario
	- Giving historical context to what’s captured
	- Photoshopping: What fantasy are they trying to create? Idea of perfection?

5) Corporations – how has our vision been filtered by leading companies that are taking over the world? Has their biasness affected us in any way? What can we do to avoid it? Do we constantly depend on them? How so?
	- How soon are we going to be subjected to their filter?
	- Finding alternatives than the use of their products
	- Are we going to fall under their grasp and be controlled, like in The Matrix?
	- Will they make money from our energy?
