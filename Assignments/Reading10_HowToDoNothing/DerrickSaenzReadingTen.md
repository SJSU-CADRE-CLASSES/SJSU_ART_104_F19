<h1>Reading 10: how to do nothing</h1>
<p>
Quick question, isnt this just plagerism?<br><br>
The first example he brings up of "just putting things on shelves" is something that could initially thought as "witty" or "creative", like "Oh hoho! Look at you! You just put stuff on a shelf and called it art!" It seems very dishonest. Someone else made that product, designed it from the ground up, and put it to manufacturing. Then this artist just puts it on a shelf and takes credit and potentially entry money from it?
