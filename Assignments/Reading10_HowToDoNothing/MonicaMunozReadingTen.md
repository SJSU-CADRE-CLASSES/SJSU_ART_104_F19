The article how to do nothing by Jenny Odell, is about the concept of doing nothing which results in actually being more productive than expected. The author presented the idea of nothing as something quite interesting and actually considerably meaningful. In a section of the reading, she mentions a rose garden in which she visits to experience true silence and ‘nothingness’ vs a terrifying world. She said that it felt to her like a survival tactic. To this I can relate because I have found myself with similar thoughts when I visit beautiful gardens. In a sense it is a way to escape from the rest of the world. I really liked the quote “providing little gaps of solitude and silence in which what a relief to have nothing to say, the right to say nothing, because only then is there a chance of framing the rare, and ever rarer, thing that might be worth saying”. We sometimes find ourselves in certain silent situations that do make us resonate on our problems or things we have to accomplish. For instance, when I have a project that I have to work on, I like to just sit back, relax and do ‘nothing’ because it helps me to be more creative and focus. The idea of clearing one's mind before performing a task, really helps to be more expressive. 
This whole topic on ‘nothingness’ is more accurate for artists because it falls under the realm of creativity. This can be frustrating to many artists because they might feel like they are not getting anywhere. In reality, it is the opposite. Even simple things such as collecting old toys, magazines, telephones, might seem like nothing much per se. However, after time of collecting it can help the artist develop new ideas that in fact can lead to great works of art.
