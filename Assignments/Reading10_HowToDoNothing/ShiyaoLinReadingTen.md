I’m surprised by myself that I finished reading the entire article, I never thought I would have done it. The article --- there’s nothing really attractive about it, but reading it makes me feel deeply relatable and healing. I appreciate the artist / author so much, despite that maybe other people don’t think she’s an artist, I do. Before reading the article, I was confused about my life and mostly, myself, and for once (at least once a day), I hated myself for doing nothing. When people ask me “what’s your hobby”, I could not come up with any fancy ideas but being in a state of daze. I love thinking, walking, even dreaming, purposely. The article tells me it’s fine to be myself, and those seem like “unnecessary” moments are necessary in our lives, which made me feel less lonely and vulnerable. For this, I have to thank this article. 

I also like that the artist uses John Clees’s Factors for Creativity:

Space
Time
Time
Confidence
Humor

With such a chaotic world we are living in and everything going on around us, it’s hard to find inner peace. Sometimes we are mistaken that creativity requires a lot of interactions with the society / community, which is somewhat true, but not always. The true inspiration always comes when we are at the most peaceful stage of ourselves, and ourselves are our own muses. We should simply let our thoughts flow, whether or not they seem make-sense at the moment. We should accept everything happening in our heads, whatever they are.
 
This article provides me motivation and belief that, every happening and existing things are meaningful. Like the artist said, “I’m suggesting that we protect our spaces and our time for non-instrumental, non-commercial activity and thought, for maintenance, for care, for conviviality. And I’m suggesting that we fiercely protect our human animality against all technologies that actively ignore and disdain the body, the bodies of others, and the body of the landscape that we inhabit.” and truly, like John Muir once said, “Longest is the life that contains the largest amount of time-effacing enjoyment.”
