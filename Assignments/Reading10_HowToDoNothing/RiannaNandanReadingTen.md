Capitalistic society has indeed changed our perception of our free time - if we are not creating something that can be quantified as productive or monetized, then it is a waste of time. However, then what do we consider “doing nothing?” 

Though the advent of constant, infallible communication has done much good for us, it is also exploited by capitalism in that work can now indeed be done from anywhere. People joke about being forced to turn off their phones while on vacation to ensure they won’t have to see or do work, but isn't that sad? I treat my phone as a way to always be able to see my friends. However, I do have an app that provides me with my work schedule. It incessantly sends off notifications of upcoming shifts, which I found ridiculous, so I turned them off. However, I once landed in a bit of trouble where my supervisor changed my schedule last minute (several hours before I was to start!), to which he asked, “well, didn’t you see the notification?” I work a minimum wage job without benefits; I’m not about to devote unpaid time to stressing over work. However, this shouldn’t be the norm for more “professional” jobs either - it encourages a culture of anxiety and obsession.
