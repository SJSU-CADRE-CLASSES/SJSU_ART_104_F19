<h1>Reading Twelve: Manufacturing Consent</h1>
<p>
Noam Chomsky said in the documentary that the New York Times was an essential force when it comes to the formation of history. They have framed many moments in history, and they have been the deciding force in what gets fed to the public in what way. I think that gives the perfect analogy of the idea of getting people to beleive what you want them to beleive, and to be convinced that they are doing it out of their own sovreignty. Instead, many people are having the sovereign thoughts be used either against them or even used to someone else's own benefit.

This idea of manufacturing consent, or shaping people's experiences, is a hijacking of critical thought. We all fall under it though, either as a the victims or the perpetrators. Gaslighting, black mailing, and any kind of manipulation come to mind when people do this, but it becomes a headline with a biased undertone when companies or nations do it.

One idea that seems to be ingrained in American culture is the extreme sense of patriotism in everything we do. All the flags hanging around, all the people with American flag or pride shirts. Its an attitude that apparently isn't shared in many other countries unless your a political candidate or a tourist.
