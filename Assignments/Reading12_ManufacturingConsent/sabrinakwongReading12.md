Quite a forward thinking mind that really comments on the media and it's control over our minds. Manufacturing Consent is a documentary of Noam Chomsky and the Media.

An intellectual of linguistics and political activist, he had the involvement of our usage of language and freedom of speech (which was rather controversial with Faurisson) . He also comments on how influential techonnologuy could be through propagnda-type means.

I agreed with his support for intellectual self-defense and independent mind and work on it. "You can't fight the world alone". 

I believe alternative media is upcoming and growing and I think they are important against coporate media and governements run by interests.
