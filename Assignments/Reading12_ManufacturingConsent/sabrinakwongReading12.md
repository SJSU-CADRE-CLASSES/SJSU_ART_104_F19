Quite a forward thinking mind that really comments on the media and it's control over our minds. Manufacturing Consent is a documentary of Noam Chomsky and the Media.

An intellectual of linguistics and political activist, he had the involvement of our usage of language and freedom of speech (which was rather controversial with Faurisson) . He also comments on how influential techonnologuy could be through propagnda-type means.

I agreed with his support for intellectual self-defense and independent mind and work on it. "You can't fight the world alone".  BY learning from trust-wrothy insitutions that serve the purpose of the people. 

I believe alternative media is upcoming and growing and I think they are important against coporate media and governements run by interests.  
 
 Overall, this documentary related to last week's podcast of the role of the internet as media and influence on political capaigns. Chomsky's view on such an event could possibly the flaw of a society that relies on mediaof interests. 
 
 I found it important to know about and listen to Chomsky's arguments on how we need to spread the awarenness of the control of our own thoughts inorder to make better decisinos that will help one's well-being and the world.
