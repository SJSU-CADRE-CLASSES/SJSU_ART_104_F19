After reading the essay my way to define design fiction is an opportunity to imagen the future. This is a way to explore new ideas, critique possible futures, and even embrace fictional stories. 

Design Fiction and Science Fiction are not too different from each other as both have a similar goal to materialize ideas and the imagination; however, science fiction is seeming to be viewed more as in form of fantasy. Yet, both are trying to create something that will make life a lot easier and even think about ideas that will measure getting some thinking off the chest. They are assemblages of various sorts, part story, part material, part idea articulating prop, part functional software. As well both have a vision of the future.

If I would start making my own design fiction, I would begin to think about things that would help me in my daily day. I would think of something that it would make sense and something that wouldnâ€™t used some imaginary source of energy. 

I would want to make a story about designing something that would help lower the pollution in the cities maybe by creating special filters on top of the buildings that would filter the pollution. Also adding some filters on the streets where there is mostly a lot of traffic. 

Bleecker talks about Ubicomp and I feel that Science Fiction does inform design as is part of the imagination of the person, so it had to think about the design to describe or even show how the person would see that piece of technology.
