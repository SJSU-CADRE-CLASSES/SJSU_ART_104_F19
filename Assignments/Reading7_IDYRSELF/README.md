In reading this article please notice the abstract format of the article. In particular, how does this article fit into the thread of topics we have covered thus far in the semester? Think about the ways that identity can be projected through technology. What are the ways the technology defines us as individuals in our world post internet? 

Some other key components to look at in this reading might be: What is the difference between the left and right columns? How do the sections relate to each other? Do you find that Krystal South accurately talks about online identity in 2019?

As always, if you have any questions or concerns, feel free to email me or drop by my regular office hours.
