At first the page was a bit confusing to follow. I wasnâ€™t sure if I read left to right or up to down since the text and images would move as I scrolled down. I figured you read it up to down so I did that. But it didn't really made sense for me so I went back to left to right and was able to understand more. As I read the article, I noticed that each column discussed a specific aspect of individual identity. The left side of the page discusses about how the Internet can impact us negatively in the sense that it makes us less of ourselves by exposing our information too much on the internet, making us less of our own,  taking away our identity. This is interesting because on the right side of the article, it discusses the various ways the internet can be used to interact with others based on the identity we portray on the web. Both of these relate to each other on how we demonstrate our identity on the internet whether it is a bad thing or not. In a way Krystal South does explain well about how identity is portrayed in the internet. But I do not believe it is necessarily a bad aspect for us to indulge in.
