<h1>Reading Seven: IDYRSELF by Krystal South</h1>
<p>
	This reading seems to be much different from the others. For one, it doesn't seem to be a linear reading, and it doesn't format itself to be either. I look at the text, and I don't know what section to jump to next sometimes. Like I can finish a paragraph, and the next one down is on the other column, and then it doesn't follow the same thought thread as the one I just read. I imagine that is is on purpose though, as the reading is still pretty cohesive and I still understand the reading based on what I have been reading.<br><br>
	The reading seems to be more questioning of the internet's culture than its use, something that seems to be what we have been alluding to in class and in the readings. The reading really likes to tell us what the interet has become. Rather than something you get on and it connects you to people, South says that "I donâ€™t go on the Internet; I am in the Internet and I am always online."<br><br>
	And I guess considering that this was written recently, I see that there has been a trend that has been set and using that, we can see where internet culture has been directed.
