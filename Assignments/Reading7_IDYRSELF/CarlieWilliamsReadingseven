First off, it is very interesting how the article itself is formatted. I like how it is divided in two and gives the reader two different perspectives. 
Firstly, the way the author states how it is easier to speak from behind the mask of the Internet via online identity brought up an interesting train of thought. Many people hide or create an online identity which can be used to interact with others without having to actually interact face to face with other people. Take Instagram influencers. They create and sculpt an online presence to what I interpret as showing off to others or trying to attract others to see how much better the influencer’s life is. The Instagram influencers create an artificial mask to show and flaunt to other people via the internet and sets off a chain reaction where those people will feel a connection because of how “transparent” the influencer is via their online presence. Another thing that reminded me of what the author stated is that some will become something they could never be while hiding behind the mask of the Internet, such as a writer but not aiming for publication. The above relates to what we previously read/watched via John Berger and James Bridles’s Way of Seeing. Where they talk how the identity of a painting and the people who owned said paintings could create a different relationship in the type of painting it is.
