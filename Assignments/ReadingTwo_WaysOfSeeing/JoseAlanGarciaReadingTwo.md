John Barger / Ways of seeing Part 1:
John Barger talks about how technology has affected the way we see Renaissance paintings by either with television screen and
also as duplicates of the art piece. I believe this can be true because as he talks about how the media that is streaming the
image can modified by just showing what they want to show making the image represent a whole different thing or add additional
effects that can affect the way one can see the painting. Also, the art piece can be affected by adding audio or music in the background.
Likewise, I like how he talks about the effect of looking at the original piece compared to looking at a duplicated piece that
is in a lower resolution and it can modified, and as well watch it in a television screen that has lower resolution and colors
can be effect by the screen of the television; however, that was because of limitations of resolution back then in the 1970s, but
now we have higher definition screens as well photographs that capture every detail of an art piece. 
John Barger / Ways of seeing Part 2:
In this part John Berger talks about woman and how were view during the European renaissance time and how they are view in a more modern
times like 70s with photograph pictures. I agree that woman always had been seen for the beauty of their bodies shape and inspired
by the art of Catholicism nudes. Even woman for those events now she seems to be more into being beautiful. I believe that the paintings
had their different views of nudes as some might seen them as the beauty of the female shape and others for sexual enjoyment; however,
times haven’t change much, there are different types of nude photographs as well still paintings about representing the sexual attractions
as well the appreciation of the shape of the human body. I think back them they would seen woman more like an object than a person,
so now in more modern times she still desirable, but there is more thought about it in a nude art piece.
John Barger / Ways of seeing Part 3:
In the third part John Berger talks about how as people we buy objects either for survival or for pleasure and talks about how
oil paintings became such a high price object. Oil paintings holds a piece of history, as there were no photographs back then.
People would use paintings as a way to remember their wealth, property, or to paint something that they love and appreciate.
Oil paintings are really beautiful and with a lot of details in them. The physical texture and tangibility of the oil paintings
makes the room look glamour. Some paintings have illustrations of the old artifacts that they used to use for everyday actives.
These paintings are a piece of history and as beautiful as they are, it should be preserved in a museum for everyone to see them. 
John Barger / Ways of seeing Part 4:
In the last part of the videos. John Berger talks about how the classic old paintings have inspired advertising posters to make
people buy, as well talked about how we became too focus on ourselves while in other places are dying. I like how they compared
color photographs with classical oil paintings and how they celebrate and share ideas like wealth and honor ship. But they both had
a different purpose, as the oil painting was about the wealth of the persons he always owns, but publicity pictures is something
to show and desired to have. This type of advertising is only to become consumers and spend money. The advertising became like
if it is sexual virility. Those who lack glamour would show as they are faceless. This is sad because even today there are a lot
of people in other countries struggling to survive and we are still a culture of material consumption. I believe this video still holds
itself well even though is from the 70s. People haven’t chance that much in almost 40 years, but there been some changes even though
they are small. It is still progress and more people are realizing and connecting better with now the internet to help others.
