Back then, an art piece could only be in one place at one time. If it had to be anywhere else, it had to be transferred to another 
location since there was only one. However, the invention of the camera changed everything. Now, an art piece could be photographed, 
printed, and shared to be in multiple places at once. Of course, they are not the original and are only copies, but this new technology 
allowed for the image of these pieces to be seen anywhere. I think these ideas especially apply to our contemporary interactions with
technology today. With nearly everyone owning a smartphone nowadays, social media platforms through which people share their lives are
very extremely prevalent. People post their work and personal lives through the internet for everyone to see. Data and information can
be replicated and shared easily. I believe that the images we interact with on social media are representative of our lives, but they do 
not include the whole picture. Rather, they only offer a glimpse into our lives as we choose what to post. In Episode 1, John Berger has
a similar comparison. The paintings displayed often had a lot going in on them. There was too much visual information to take in at once,
so the viewer would have to look at the paintings in smaller sections, and the context of the painting would change depending on the 
section being focused on. One corner could be a landscape painting and the other a depiction of a crucifixion, but these details are lost
when looking at the entire painting from afar. Likewise, the images on social media are these small glimpses into our lives and do not 
offer all information. Another example Berger gives is the painting of the cornfield with birds flying around. At a first glance it’s jus
t a simple painting, but its context completely changes when we learn that it is Van Gough’s final painting before he killed himself. 
These images do shape our collective perception of reality. The images we share are carefully selected to display the best of us. No one
would want to post something that would make themselves look bad, and as a result, social media only shows the self that we want others 
to see. This idea can be extended into other types of technology but I believe its most relevant to social media. Images in advertisement
campaigns are not the only form of persuasion in 2019, but I believe they are the most impactful. Other forms of persuasion in 
advertisement could be sound, but when people encounter an ad, it is primarily visual. I think visual ads are most effective since I 
feel like that is the memory we retain the best when we see a quick advertisement.
