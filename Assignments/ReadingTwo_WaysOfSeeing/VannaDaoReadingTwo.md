I agree with Berger, I believe artwork has always played a role in the demonstration of power and prestige. 

The way the characters pose are for the spectators to feel applease by. I can see those being applied to the digital artworks today. 
If we look at the advertisements now, the concept and design is made to appeal to the audience. This way can cause the audience to get the 
things that advertise or get caught up with the artworks. Through the internet, there are many pornographic pictures and advertisements. 
Many of those images have nudity and many have their eyes looking at the camera for the audience. The way the models pose is also to 
appeal to the audience. Today, women are still getting called names for dressing in their erotic images. Many images I realize on the 
internet, the models have the perfect body figure similar to the paintings from the past. That’s something that still occurs to us but 
now there are brands that are being more diverse with different body types and nationality.

Portraits were only bought by the rich. Many of the portraits were about the rich class people. It’s interesting how there were only 
a few paintings of the rich class. The lower class do not own a portrait nor were painted in a portrait. But today, we see portraits of 
everyone in different classes, they could be high, middle, or low class. This could be found not only in oil painting but in other art 
mediums such as photography. And with technology, we are able to reproduce the past artwork where anyone can own one. We are able to 
reprint the artwork in high quality. 

It’s interesting how oil painting portraits is based on highly personal and exceptional visions. For example, Mr. and Mrs. Andrew see 
themselves as the owner of their wheat field. When Berger describes it this way compared to the one before where it just describes the 
wheat field painting, this changed my whole vision about what this oil painting meant since I’ve only thought about it as a landscape 
peace with a couple. Today, we see images of those high class but the view point has a different meaning than before. We see those images 
as a what if we had this kind of life. Showing the images of high class, I feel like that motivates us to want to work hard so that we 
can have that kind of life where it is easygoing.  

In paintings, there are objects and treasures. It’s interesting how Berger mentions that the audience who sees those objects and treasures
will also want to own it. They will buy something similar to it. I think it’s interesting how it’s something we still see today through 
advertisements. There are many advertisements today through posters, television, media, games, social media, and many more. Advertisements
show up a lot more often now through the browser. Through my experience, it’s interesting how the advertisements knows what I want to get
and it will show me the discount price of it. This was very tempting for me.
