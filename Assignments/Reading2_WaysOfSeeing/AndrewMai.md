Episode 1:

John Berger goes into discussion with a painting and how authentic production differs greatly against those created through the rise of technology. With the invention of camera, it allowed many to see paintings from all over the world and gives a different perspective of what the camera allows to happen. He then proceeds to question the message and mood the painting within a camera medium tells. Because with the inclusion of sound and camera angles, it could potentially be given a whole different atmosphere to the viewer and then makes it as if the film is the art piece and the painting is the subject while the cameraman is the artist.

I definitely agree with Berger stand on how a medium can change a piece. It is nearly impossible to view all the paintings in the world and photography and film are just an easy way for us to access those pieces, but then we are only allowed to see through the perspective of the camera man. With the growing technology in our time, virtual reality has become a staple and we already see that implemented into museums to try and replicate that experience of seeing the painting in real life.


Episode 2:

This episode revolves around Berger analyzing the perspective of women in nude paintings and what they are symbolized as. In Berger’s discussion, nudity is seen as an object for women that are for appeal and satisfaction for the male viewers and male audience. Most illustration symbolizes the man finding his worth and showing growth while the woman is viewed as weak and fragile, waiting for their rescue. This analysis relates to a particular woman that argues because of this constant perspective, women are inclined to raise themselves to that standard of fantasy that men portray. Another woman says it becomes difficult to make a claim for themselves without being viewed as a second-rate compared to a man.

Women during this time were definitely seen as an inferior so it made it seem like wearing clothes were a privilege or a sign of independence. However, as of 2019, I have definitely seen a rise of women independence and has shown great growth towards the society, creating a more equality mindset when we raise the next generation.

Episode 3:

Berger dives into the symbolism behind objects in paintings like fruits and animals. Old European traditional paintings were definitely seen as a form of luxury and wealth and by placing how many of these objects you paint, it increases the value of the painting itself. Portraits are another example of displaying power within that person. The purpose behind this is to demonstrate how wealthy the commissioner is and to not make their achievements any less significant.

This was an interesting episode for me as I had no idea these items were deemed as luxury. Nowadays, I feel social media and photos are our replacement for paintings and everyone can see another person’s definition of wealth. The most common definition and example of displaying that wealth is when you see someone constantly at a resort or wearing branded clothing. Although it has no value to me, it means a lot to most people that follow these “instagram influencers”.

Episode 4:

The final episode of Ways of Seeing showcases the power of photography and its rapid use within society. Photography seems to be a new medium to replace painting and connects with the audience more as it replicates reality. Interestingly, photographers use models to try and mimic the position of old traditional paintings as it worked as “successful” in the old era so they try to modernize the old styles.

I found ads like @credit on Instagram is a similar example to this model of marketing and publicity ads. He has a friend program that gets his followers and viewers to sign up for his program to get all the secrets of achieving his lifestyle of sex and money. The marketing of his page is filled with travel, money, and tons of women which gets a lot of people desiring his lifestyle. Best of all, he makes it seem possible with the constant reviews he gets back to his page and shows bank statements on how much money is rolling into his account. Ultimately, I think of it as a scam but it is the marketing that does so well that reels people in so he might be a genius too.
