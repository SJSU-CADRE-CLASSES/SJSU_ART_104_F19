I thought this reading, Why good design matters, is very interesting. “Design exerts so much power over so many aspects of our 
lives that the quality of a design project can be a decisive factor in deciding whether we will enjoy happiness and success, or 
be subjected to misery, failure or worse.” When I read this quote, I agree with this quote in many ways. When I read the story of 
Aimee Mullins and her journey with her prosthetic legs design, I can see the effort and dedication she has put into her designs. 
She took her design to a whole new level, where instead of having prosthetic that looks like a human, she created unique designs 
such as the cheetah prosthetics legs. She was also able to enhance the design of the leg prosthetics to make it fit for running 
and more comfortable for the user.  

When I read this, this made me think of the game consoles and portables created by Nintendo. When we look at the design from the 
Nintendo Entertainment System and Game Boy to the Nintendo Switch, we can see how much the design of the consoles and portable 
have changed and have advanced. The Nintendo Entertainment System was only able to connect to the television and the Game Boy was 
only a portable console system. The Game Boy could connect to the television but has to be connected to the Gamecube, which was 
another console created by Nintendo after the Nintendo Entertainment System. Now we have the Nintendo Switch which can be a 
console connected to a television and a portable console to play whenever and wherever you want. 

Another design that has improved is gaming designs. Back when games first came out, the players would only sit down and press on 
controllers while watching the television. They didn’t have any body movement which can be very unhealthy. Later in 2006, Nintendo 
came out with a console called Wii. This allowed the players to move physically and that’s what Nintendo was aiming for the players 
to have a healthy body instead of just sitting there on the couch all day. This console caught the parents attention since they want 
their kids to move around and exercise. This console system did change the whole gaming community as other game companies like 
Playstation and Xbox wanted to create something similar to it such as the Playstation Eye and the Playstation Kinect. As the years 
went by, we now have the virtual reality headset games where it allow the players to move and be in the game at the same time. 
Players are able to play this in a wide space. This game design is unique and very fun and allows the player to use their senses 
and be healthy at the same time. One game that I really enjoy in virtual reality is Saber Beats, where you swing your arms around 
to hit the beat of the music and dodge obstacles by moving your body to a certain side. We now also see some previous games going 
for this idea such as Minecraft and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Players are now able to feel like they are in the game.
