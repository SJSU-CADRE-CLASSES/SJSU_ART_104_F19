<h1>Reading Five: Why Good Design Matters by Alice Rawsthorn </h1>

Alice Rawsthorn brings up various good points regarding good design. In all the examples, she brings up cases how design has been useful or detrimental to the end product depending on the quality of the design. The most striking is the last example, as it had to do with the presidential elections, something that effects millions of people. A poor design invalidated thousands of votes, and even though it was made of the best intentions, it still ended up being a huge detriment to the voters of Florida. Bad design is something everyone notices and can complain about, even if they canâ€™t put a finger on what they complaining about. Good design is invisible, but it saves a lot of time, hassle, and money.
<br>An example I think of is a person with back problems. Someone who has had back problems for a while, they will stop noticing it. The pain will become constant and they will be so used to it, that it will constantly effect them but they won't notice. But once they go to a chiropractor, they realize the pain they have been through and thrive from having this obstacle removed from them. Likewise, if a design is bad, then if the bad design lasts long enough, it will become a norm and people will deal with it, but it will lose efficiency and money. Once a new better design comes out, people will jump to that and that new design will gain more money than the last one ever could.
