Why does good design matter? Why should creators design the best prototype, or the best model for a specific machine or gadget? Why does design matter in the process of building? This reading sparked a lot of questions in my head. It also impacted me in an emotional way, especially when I came across the topic of Aimee Mullins, and the evolution of her prosthetic legs. “It’s really a shame that you care what you look like, Aimee. You’re an amputee, you just need to accept that”-- this quote that tackles the concept of acceptance is a huge factor in design. Accepting the limitations and the challenges of creating a prototype usually paves the way in creating a successful solution. Mullins went through different struggles overcoming her problems in terms of her disability. She was a dreamer, who worked hard to conquer the goals that she has set for herself as an aspiring athlete. As she faced different obstacles whether it was in school or at home-- she seeked more help in terms of designing great prototypes for her prosthetic legs.

This is why good design matters. Good design matters for people in need. But it’s not only targeted for specific people. Good design matters for everyone.

We all seek efficiency and good solutions for our daily problems. Whether it’s from waking up to a wonky alarm system, searching for the nearest bus stop or learning how to ride the newest lime bicycle around downtown--- good design helps our lives become better. As I’m typing this response to this article, if these designers did not design how google documents work in a way it automatically saves the document and my laptop lost its power, I would have lost all the contents I wrote. These good designs that we come across every single day makes our lives faster, well organized and stronger. It really goes down on how human beings use these outlets.
“Many of the greatest design feats go unnoticed: they do their job so well that we are barely aware of them, happy to congratulate ourselves for having solved a problem or made some sort of progress”. This is exactly true, as we go on our lives not thinking that the things we used were designed specifically for the functionality we were looking for. Creators design things for a specific order. It’s meant to be done for convenience, and so that we can do things in a simpler and easier way.

Good design is essential. Good design is fundamental for our living. Some designers are often asked to make things look more attractive and aesthetically pleasing. But good design doesn’t mean it needs to look pretty, some are just made for experiences to be more beneficial and comfortable.

Like the Zurich Airport that was discussed in the article, the signs created for the airport really helps the travellers that are not familiar to the location. The illustrated symbols were easily recognizable for the different amenities provided. This was done by a designer named Ruedi Rueggs. 
In conclusion, this article was definitely relatable and I will always believe that Good Design Matters.
