<h1>Reading Eleven: Cambridge Analytica Whistleblower</h1>
<p>
There has been constant comparison to the idea that WWIII would be fought digitially, and seemingly it is coming true. The Cambrige Analytica scandal is something I haven't been able to fully comprehend because of how out there it is, at least until someone comes down and explains it in layman's terms. I am somewhat versed in technology, but the idea that this inferconnected interent world is more interconnected than we expected and that we are all being subconsciously manipulated into beleiving what someone else wants is always a new thing to think about because you are directly being involved. 

With how big the internet is, the easy thing to do is to just convince yourself that you aren't being affected by most of the things going on in the world and that it isn't your problem. However, "everyone" uses Facebook now. Even if you don't have an account, you still use it because all your friends do. Everything is stracked by one of the biggest tech companies of our time, and we have had no idea how they are using that data until now, when it really really matters. The Cambridge Analytica scandal seems to have been directly effecting a lot of the important elections and decisions, including our 2016 election. This is bad, really really bad. Someone else is trying to take our democracy away by hijacking it and using it against the common people.
