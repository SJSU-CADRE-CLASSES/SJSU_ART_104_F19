In the Think Big article “Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie: the cognitive segregation of America” Jason Gots and  former Cambridge Analytica employee Christopher Wylie discuss the dilemma that the company experienced while trying to alter the opinions of American civilians. Wylie, after learning that his employer Cambridge Analytica was taking users information and using it in an unethical manner, he whistle blew the predicament to the public. He comments that our own smart devices may currently be listening and communicating with one another to learn our interests and later on recommending new products or ideas. This may sound beneficial to some, privacy invading to others, while Wylie suggests that these devices may be altering the “recommendations” to benefit a company or campaign demands. Our smart devices, and the internet is manipulating us into believing what they want.

I do believe that with the quick advancements in technology and smart devices, we are subjecting ourselves to this kind of manipulation more and more each day. I have an Echo Alexa at home and on multiple occasions I have found that the light has been on, listening, when I have not said the activating word “Echo”. Similarly, I have noticed that I receive Instagram ads about things that I have only spoken about shortly before.

Wylie also focuses on ways that Facebook has taken users’ information to build secret profiles and create platforms of people who all have similar interests, some politically charged. This type of platform can unite people with similar interests and provide them with the satisfaction of “fitting in”, but it can also have many negative impacts. Cyber groups have the tools to come together and plan extremist acts without ever meeting in person. This is perhaps how the Charlottesville protest came to be, where white supremisist gathered ended in the death of a woman citizen.
