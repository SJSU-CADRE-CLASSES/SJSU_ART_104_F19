Before reading this "article" some thoughts and questions that came in mind would be these:

Isn't hiding whistleblowers against a more just society? 
This article, cross of techonology and politics and looks at the changing of our governemental systems and culture. Privatizaion o f public discourse for private profit.The flip side of the movements online that can become negative.
Warfare of resource contraint and politics on the internet. 

Then it goes into a partifular set of actions done by Christopher Wylie that changed politics through the net. More than that, this big think had a conversation of the information exchanged to our daily lives and the different agendas given through media. 

Hackers are able to influence politics by building modern defenses online. Listening to how Wylie was able to do all of this was mind-boggilin.
What modern ways to influence great masses at once? Social media and many social websites where one can post, write, share, comment, and continue all the day.

I found this very relevant as I started College during the 2016 Trump campaign and have looked at some posts regarding politics and talking to some of these people in person. It amazes me how much they really believe many of the sources online, especially FB to the extent that they do not want to talk to people who disagree.
I find that poeple really need to learn how to read sites and media online but also big companies changing their regulation towards what media they distribute to vulnerable minds.

People will unite through hate, love, loss and unity. A video, reading, influencer, leader, and movement can then change the direction of how we think. 

This podcast shines light on a very important topic of cyber security and data distrubution tha to influence consumers. What are the blurred rights of people who interect with all this technology controlled by private companies?
Will information dominance be constant or can we have equal access to the right information in order to make the right decisions?
