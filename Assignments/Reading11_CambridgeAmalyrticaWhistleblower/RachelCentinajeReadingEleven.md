Christopher Wylie whistleblowed Cambridge Analytica, a British political consulting firm collected data from 87 million Facebook users to create a psychological warfare tool to change them, and influence their vote. From listening to this podcast, It sounds more scarier put in perspective, to hear about how information is being consumed differently. Instead of consuming information one way through radio, tv, newappers, but since the rise of social media, its a two way street to basically giving them our interests, personal messages, pictures, etc. and having us interact and being influenced. I think it's personally scary to know that my information can be looked at and used without me noticing. In the past, we notice that the media has been an important influence on changing the minds of people. Wylie quoted Andrew Breitbart that “Culture is Downstream of Politics”. It’s interesting that money is not really being used to buy actual weapons like bombs, but instead psychological warfare to accomplish information dominance on the masses. People who are data scientist analysis, hackers are being hired to change society. As a society, it’s hard to believe what we hear, and we need to be skeptical about the information thats out there can influence us.
