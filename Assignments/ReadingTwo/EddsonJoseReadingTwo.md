I believe the concepts presented in the series are relevant today. The idea of the visible world converging into a single point, the eye or the camera, is especially true today given the abundance of cameras and the greater quality of images the camera reproduces. With the internet the ability to view an image taken by cameras can be done anywhere at anytime  – the images come to the viewer. The most relevant concept discussed in the series was that the meaning of an image can be changed according to what is seen beside it or what comes before/after. A simple Google image search places a gallery of images before the viewer cluttering the eye with information forcing the viewer to isolate their gaze onto a single image. Whether the image search has provided a gallery of relevant images or not the image that is being viewed will always be tainted by the images seen around it. But what difference does this make compared to entering a physical gallery where images, sculptures, and installations surround the viewer in all directions? I believe negative space plays a big role in the difference between the physical gallery and the virtual. In a physical gallery the negative space between each object is vast and even more so when the viewer moves closer to the object in view. An internet gallery works in a similar fashion albeit with very little negative space between images. If one were to focus in on the image a less cluttered representation will come to view; if one were to click the image one more time for an isolated view the image would be viewed, still, in the frame of the browser. But is it so distracting that it diverts or changes the meaning of an image? How does it compare to the frame of an oil painting in a museum? 

We interact with images on social media through likes, dislikes, and comments as a representation of an idealized life curated but still tainted by what was once seen or seen beside it. We can try our best to live the idealized life but the experiences of others will never be ours. In a way social media is representative of our lives everything we see becomes a part of our experience we can chose the experiences we like and dislike, however, those experiences will always be in our mind constantly reforming the meaning of the things we see everyday thus shaping our perception of reality. Television and radio are a couple other forms of technology that reiterate the ideas represented by social media. Each form that I have mentioned above contain a persuasion unrelated to ad campaigns. Television for example showcase reality tv shows that announce how people should live their lives. 

I don’t think artwork always played a role in the demonstration of power and prestige because many artworks demonstrate technique, style, or anything but power and prestige. For example, William Hodges who traveled with Captain Cook painted landscapes in realism for scientific purposes.
