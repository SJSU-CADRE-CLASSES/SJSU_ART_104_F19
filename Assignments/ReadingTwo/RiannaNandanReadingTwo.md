	The camera has definitely changed our perception of art and the world, though I do think it has been for the better overall. After all, we are able to see so many sights that, without it, we’d never be able to experience - whether it be the landscapes of distant countries, or priceless paintings kept in museums half a world away, we’re able to enjoy things far beyond our local reach. Even if the work is diminished through the camera (such as being unable to see the entire piece, or not getting the full atmospheric effect of its location), I believe that being able to experience it in some form is better than not being able to see it at all. Of course, work being shared in this way is not something that the artists creating it at the time would have ever been able to imagine. It’s interesting to think how one can interpret an artwork through their method of sharing it (such as adding sound or other effects) and how that can affect others perception of it.
