Episode 1:

The first episode was an interesting listen as Bridle mentions a Cybernetic Forest which is the incorporation of technology and nature in one setting. This was a relatable discussion because of some of my works involving the piece and its environment it belongs in. I relate this to a lot of graffiti art and how its placement really sets the mood of where it is painted on compared to the same art painted on a canvas and mounted in a gallery space instead. They also dive into how technology are just as human as we are and we are not using it properly to its full characteristic potential which was an interesting thought. It really drove me to think about the relationship we have with computers as a tool instead of using it to our advantage.

Episode 2:

I like to argue that with the ever increasing advancement with technology, we see less of realism and more of artworks, especially with Photoshop nowadays. I constantly see on Instagram of photographers giving their portraits a look into their lens, but that isn't to say that they removed some imperfections just to get the photo perfect in their eyes. But this does imply of old habits that transcend into technology and we just grow up with that vision and adjust to that. In some ways, you can say technology forces us to think a certain way as a negative point, but on the opposite side of the spectrum, it gives more creative freedom and diversity to some that can free themselves from that vision. I personally view nude women as a sign of power now because of past articles I have read.


Episode 3:

This episode goes with the same point that I mentioned before on how advanced Photoshop is becoming and how it gives artist the ability to manipulate photos to make it surreal which gives fake perspective of the actual location. I remember reading upon an article on how an Instagram influencer photoshopped name branded logos onto plain white T-shirts and used it as a marketing technique for himself to sell his program and achieve that lifestyle. It was all a scam, but that is technology at its level right now and is only ever going to further develop. It is not technology to blame, but the people that have access to it and know how to use it. Props for him for being able to monetize that niche, though, but morally it is an awful characteristic of him.

Episode 4:

The internet and technology definitely has a powerful grasp in our lives. Especially living in the Silicon Valley where it is the heart of technology, it really is impossible to live here without the access of internet or owning a smartphone. I relate this to credit cards because those are necessary tools in our life which can only be obtained through banks which need our information to place on the internet. Then they sell our data to other banks and that is how they make money. Just for necessities like that already, our information is forever on the web, but at this time of age, it should just be a given knowledge of what you get yourself into when you first connect yourself to wifi. I respect those that manage to live without it, but I canâ€™t see myself to build a career without technology.
