-------------------------------------

For the fifth reading of the semester, please read Why Good Design Matters by Alice Rawthson:

In this reading Rawthson considers design within multiple context including, the official Fifa Football, prosthetics, and airport signage. Take some time to think about how these elements help to define our reality. Does the world exist without design? Is good design important? What are some examples of good design that you have seen? What are some examples of bad design that you have seen? Try to consider the many roles that design plays in your life and if there are potential alternatives to design realities that you take for granted on a day to day basis.
