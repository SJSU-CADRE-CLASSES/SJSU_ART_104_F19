In the article, "Why Good Design Matters" by Alice Rawthson illustrates why design is very powerful and how the way things are designed can affect us in our daily lives.The author uses different instances such as the soccer ball design, using signs to navigate through the airport, and even filling out a ballot.  Design shouldnâ€™t just be used for function, but it should also be about how it looks aesthetically as well. Aimee Mullins, is an actor, model, and athlete that pushes design of prosthetics to be beautiful, fun, and creative. Hugh Herr, a mountain climber, American engineer, pushes prosthetics to even outperform real limbs. I briefly watched his ted talk and he made a really good point about how throughout the years, how come the design of a shoe continues to give us blisters. Not only do shoes should look aesthetically nice, but just knowing how to build one that is comfortable is not something a lot of designers consider. Today, Adidas Ultraboosts are designed with thermoplastic polyurethane that compresses under pressure for better shock absorption. There still needs to be better range of shoes that can be comfortable and designed aesthetically. These two pushes design in a way to help improve the world and help those who need these prosthetics just so they can perform tasks. Design helps us to make things easier for us as well as its also used to make us feel a certain way when displaying, wearing, or using them.
