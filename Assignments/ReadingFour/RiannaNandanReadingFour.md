Design Fiction is the conception of ideas in art that draw from a potential future version of our world. It has a basis in science fiction, but often has themes relating to current events or social issues. It uses the concept of Sci-Fi to create a discussion around real-world issues, and designs that may one day be able to better our lives. 

The genre of Cyberpunk is adjacent to Design Fiction. Though it has many heavily sci-fi elements, it often uses these themes to combat issues such as corporate greed and corruption, transhumanism, gender, and our relationships with technology. Variance in specific instances of the genre are high, but they almost always combat dangerous capitalistic dystopias. 

Lark’s work often has design fiction themes, such as their recent installation on a craigslist-esque personals site designed for the future. It also brought up the portential social issues between robots, humans, and other beings coexisting in the same space. 

For me, if I were to create a piece in the vein of design fiction, I would start by thinking about how we’re going to interface with digital networks in the future. Right now, cell phones and computers are our main devices, but will these be what we use forever? What kinds of new communicative devices will we have one day?

Science fiction can definitely inform the process of creating real technologies. An example is virtual reality - though it isn’t yet what people once predicted it would be, with an entire transportation of consciousness to a virtual world - the concept is the same, and it is constantly being worked on to be better. It is much cheaper and accessible now than ever before, and its technology is always improving. 

Even with science fiction, however, we have always discovered things that were inconceivable to humans only a decade before their invention. The way we communicate now is so far beyond the understanding of people from a hundred years ago. It’s true that silicon and materials do have physical processing limits, but where will we be a hundred years from now?
