For the fourth reading of the semester, please read Julian Bleecker's 2007 Design Fiction:

https://drbfw5wfjlxon.cloudfront.net/writing/DesignFiction_WebEdition.pdf

Read this essay and think about how you might define Design Fiction. How is it different from Science Fiction? What are some examples that you can point to of design fiction? Are there any artist that come to mind? If you were to begin to create your own design fiction, where would you begin? What possible story would you want to design for? What are the artifacts that you might create?

Bleecker gets into a bigger conversation about Ubicomp later in the essay. Do you feel that Science Fiction does inform design? Can science fiction form an important role in how technology is produced?

As always, please have your responses posted to the class git by the beginning of class and be prepared to speak about your reactions to the essay.
