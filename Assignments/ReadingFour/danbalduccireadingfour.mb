Design is a practice with the ability to travel and be taken up in various creative material making endeavors. Design is a kind of creative way of describing and materializing ideas that are still looking for the right place to live. Design fiction is a conflation of design, science fact, and science fiction. Materializing ideas and speculations with a safe test product.Science fiction can be understood as an idea that creates prototypes of other worlds, experiences and other contexts for life based on creative insight. Design fiction such as Tom Zachâ€™s space camp where he engages with performance art to engage his audience. In Space camp, the design fiction is the story, materials, and ideas articulating proper and functional devices and software. Most importantly it allows to create conversations about the kinds of experiences and social rituals that might surround these designed objects. It is a way of exploring different view and approaches, a more honest and direct genre. If I was to create my own design fiction, I would play with the concept of media and the big screen. I would have a story where the big screen representing a TV would literally be telling us what to buy, and where to buy directly. Artifacts such as advertisement, ads, found objects to tell a story about representation and marketing. Science fiction does inform design or at least contribute to it because it is ideas that are extending from the thinkers. Science fiction is important to have different ways of viewing the future and the way individuals see society in this way. Science fiction defamiliarizes us to newer technology in a way for us to examine new possible forms, styles and experiences.
