After reading this essay, I would define Design Fiction as a practice that involves with imagination but within those imagination 
involves a story of how the object is being created and how it is being thought out. Through the process involves drawing sketches 
and ideas. The ideas of Design Fiction is stories reflected from the past. Science Fiction creates alternative possibilities that can 
happen in the future. Science Fiction is stories based off about the present and are reflections of the past. To make the future better, 
they can improve on the technology and learn from the past. 

If I were to create my own design fiction, I would first start off with my own imagination thinking about how this “thing” can be 
helpful for the future. The “thing” comes to my mind when I do activities such as jogging, watching japanese animation, and etc. When 
I watch animation, it allows me to be creative and think of something unique and bizarre. When my idea comes to my mind, I would 
quickly write down the ideas in my sketchbook. And later I would draw the design of the physical form of the “thing”. Later, I 
would also share my ideas of the “thing” to my friends and see what I can add, change, or improve on. One artifact I would like to 
create is an Augmented Reality for the environments and animals we may lose in the future. An example would be the glaciers located 
at Greenland and Antarctica. Those glaciers are melting due to global warming and that was something caused by society with creating 
factories and gas.  The polar bears are going extinct due to the loss of their habitat. I want to create this design into reality for 
society to remember the environments from the past that they have lost. I want this to hopefully help society improve and won’t allow 
a loss of environment to happen again.

Yes, I do feel that Science Fiction does inform design. Science fiction form is an important role in how technology is produced. With 
science fiction, we are able to improve and advanced in technology. An example would be cellphones, back then it used to look like a 
giant break. In the design, there are also buttons to press on numbers. As time went by, the cellphone became smaller so it can fit in 
our pockets. Those cellphones later became a fullscreen with touchscreens enhanced. The phone that started this was the iPhone 4s. This 
cellphone changed the whole era of cellphones. The iPhone 4s has applications that can help our everyday life such as an alarm clock, 
camera, social media, calculator, global positioning system, internet, and many more. Now today, we see many cellphones borrow this same 
design but have enhanced the technology. These technologies include bluetooth, voice recognition system, artificial intelligence, 
global positioning system, language translator, and many more. Science Fiction is something that we need so we can improve on technology 
for the society while reflecting on the past.
