Julian Bleecker defines design fiction as a mixture between science fiction and design. I was a bit confused by what Bleecker meant but then as I read the article, I began to understand more of what the author meant. The difference between design fiction and science fiction, is that design fiction is more imaginative but materilitics with the work while science fiction expands on the idea and purpose of the work, more “what if’s”. However, they both share the concept of formulating ideas to create something practical.

One example of design fiction is electric cars. These cars were created in order to prevent damage and emission created by pollution into the air. A different creation could have been done in order to reduce pollution but so far inventing electric cars has been more practical and effective since the majority of people drive and they are much cheaper than cars that run on gas. 

In my opinion, science fiction does inform design and plays an important role in technology because of the current technology we have to benefit us such as cars, artificial organs created by 3-D machines, and virtual reality.
