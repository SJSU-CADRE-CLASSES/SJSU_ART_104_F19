In the New Ways of Seeing by James Bridleâ€™s podcast, he brings up that the internet has hidden inner workings that people tend to not see. This can be dangerous because people who use the internet daily have no idea what actually goes on when they access a site daily. For example, Google was exposed that they kept record of your search history and sold that information to advertisers. Not to mention whenever you used the Facebook app on your phone, it automatically listened in on your conversation so it can target advertisements based on whatever you say. In the second episode, they talk about how digital images affect modern day society. As in how media is now utilized to images or experiences that no one could possibly achieve via physical media. Like how there can be double exposure perfected to crystal clear clarity, or how people can edit photos digitally at the ease of clicking a mouse. The third episode discusses social justice and how women were pushed out of the tech industry where women now are seen as up and coming versus being the actual founders of the tech industry. This is relatable because men are now seen as smart or innovative when coming into the tech industry and women are treated as if they have never touched a computer in their lives if they work within the tech industry.
