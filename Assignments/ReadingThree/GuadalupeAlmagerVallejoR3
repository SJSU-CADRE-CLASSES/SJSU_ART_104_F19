In episode one, James Bridle focuses in changing people’s perspective of how they see technology He wondered how it would be like if nature and technology became one piece. The only problem with this is the fact that it is so far of reach from being able to accomplish. It can also be problematic to the environment, which I agree because it can endangered animal species  and nature as a whole. He also discusses how we use technology simply as an advantage for us, but not really appreciate it. I feel this statement is true due to the fact that technology is becoming more enhanced in order to make our daily routine more simple. For the second episode, Dr. Luis Sovie discusses her experience with her ID being denied because of her Dr. title and the machine assuming she’s a male when she wanted to enter the women’s locker.  The only way to get in is to drop the Dr title. I found that sexist because any gender can receive a Dr title, not just males. Because of this, her goal is to create and program. improved AI to prevent issues like this. I found this a great idea because it would not make people feel discriminated against. The third episode discusses how the images often give a false representation of reality. Many people manipulate the views by altering the image with either editing programs and social media. This is true, especially with programs such as Photoshop. Anyone can enhance their photograph to make themselves look and feel better, thus giving themselves a false image of them. The final episode brings the topic of how people use the internet only for profit rather than to benefit themselves. Also big companies tend to hold people’s own information for their own profit and money.
