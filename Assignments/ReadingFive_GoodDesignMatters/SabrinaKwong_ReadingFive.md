This week’s reading really opens one’s mind to the power of design and the motivation of it. The article, by Rawsthorn, started a quote that touches areas of awareness of it role when accidents, disaster and crisis happens and how everything depends on a good design.I believe in good design, as most DMA teachers would say, it solves problems and for me , it makes life easier with beauty.

A clear point of the case of Andrew Chen and the finishing of the product design deadline would be money due to corporate pursuits. Yet the article also introduces more reasons why design matters. From happiness to success to misery, failure and at times death. 

I also learned that there are such things as design historians (example John Heskett) and how he linked design and language as the same- unavoidable, how we think and communicate. Prosthetics are an example of designs that those who are disabled and many athletes, star and college, have been the ones to test out bad designs, good ones, and rather fashionable ones. 

What does a good design communicate and stand for?

I am inspired by Mullins determination in creating the right prosthetics as a double amputee that fitsher needs and wants and how she sought many professionals in many fields for her quest. From woven carbon-fibre ‘shock absorbers’ ( 65) to human realistic flesh- like legs, to fashion fantasy legs, she has as Rawsthorns mentions: “... chosen to make herself faster, stronger, taller and weirder by commissioning specific types of legs with which she can enhance her natural beauty, athleticism and theatricality.” She knew she was capable of more if people worked together to design  the right prosthetics.

Besides physically touchable designs, designs exist everywhere the eyes can see in our everyday lives. On the contrary, a famous bad design exmple that I have heard of where the design of the ballot cards and the glitch of the machine systems that ate them for the 2000 US presidential elections of VP Al Gore against Beroge W.Bush. Therefore, bad design can either make it or break it in the outcomes we hope to search for or are pursuing.

I think that without good design, so much will be lost. So let's work together and listen to each other to make better designs, please.
