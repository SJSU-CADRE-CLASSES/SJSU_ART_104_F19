Reading Six Response
The reading advocates the further reengineering and redeploying of existing technologies to regulate menstruation or manufacture hormones, widening ownership of medical and pharmaceutical expertise to individuals rather than the state or corporations. Xenofeminism stresses that the forces of technology – like any given individual – do not operate in omnipotent isolation but within a complex web of power dynamics. Liberation through technology will therefore work in tandem with changes in political, social and interpersonal relations. The spheres of family and reproductive justice – often dismissed or ignored in politics – are emphasized as sites of potential emancipation, offering opportunities to develop alternative methods of reproduction and collaborative strategies of care and childrearing. Laboria recognizes that, as greater connectivity and technological advances have broken down barriers and networked the world, so exploitation exists – and must be resisted – on a global rather than local scale. The ways forward that she tentatively identifies are conscious of gender’s intersections with race and class, for instance around access to health services and the racially inflected history of medical intervention and experimentation. Xenofeminism’s “gender-abolitionist” feminism goes beyond a call for parity between binary genders and anticipates a future in which differences proliferate infinitely, rendering gender decreasingly relevant as an axis of oppression – about as significant as the color of one’s eyes. There is a lot to appreciate in Xenofeminism, and its goal for the ornate future.
