This reading is definitely a little more hard to follow and seems to be an artful writing that is meant to sound cool and maybe a bit poetic rather than being clear and concise in its wording. It does bring up a lot of interesting points though and different ways of thinking about things. 

One thing that was a new idea to me is building freedom by denying nature. I've always found appeals to nature to be kind of a bad argument and wondered why we are drawn to things just because they're "natural." 

The idea that technology isn't inherently progressive is interesting too. While we usually think of advancement in science and technology as progress, and it is in a more literal interpretation of the word, it isn't the same thing as the concept of progression in terms of social values. Technological progression can be used to take away people's freedoms just as easily as it can grant them. 

Some of the usually feminism ideas are present too, with ideas like rationality not being a gender-based value. It's good that they included things like this that still have widespread bias, even though people are aware of and denounce the bias in public. 

Some of the stuff I don't really understand yet how they're really related to feminism, I guess. Social justice in general, sure, but the ideas don't seem particularly connected to gender issues. 

While I'm not sure of the feminist relevance, I really understand the ideas that they're putting forth about platforms that have such a great potential for learning and sharing being muddied by the ways they can be negatively exploited. The fetishization of oppression and shaming and all of that is such a huge issue that's really difficult to talk about.

I appreciate their TL;DR at the bottom of the page that sums up the essence of their manifesto. It's a really good idea and a great way to think about things. The website design itself is very bright and a pretty rough on the eyes, but it is set up in a neat way and is definitely more digestible with each idea on its own little page while still being easy to navigate through.
