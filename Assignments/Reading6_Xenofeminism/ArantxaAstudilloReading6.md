Xenofeminism is the belief that we as humans should not condone to the common practice of acting a certain way because others perceive us in that way. XF is to be no one in particular. This does not only mean women fighting for equal rights, it means all persons regardless of gender, sexual orientation, race, age, class to be treated equally though the eyes of other humans and through the eyes of all digital softwares. The internet initially promised a space where we could do exactly this, be no one in particular. However I personally do not feel that I can be “no one” on the internet. Making myself a Facebook for example, required entering personal information such as my gender, birthdate, schools, occupation; and yes you can choose to ignore all of these, ignoring ALL of these would defeat the purpose of FB. Aside from social media, it also seems that in this digital age, the internet seems to know many of my interests and therefore organize ads that it believes I will be interested in. It has been proven that even job searching sites have an AI that appears to be biased against particular gender and race, which obviously skews the applicants towards a general direction.  XF wants to change this; however it cannot possibly be done without strong planning and organizing. Emancipation of gender, race, class is simply non existent, and that is why FX would have to settle for negotiation.
