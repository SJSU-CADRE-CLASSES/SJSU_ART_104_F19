For our first reading, I decided to read the article, "The Traveling Salesman Problem and AI"
by Vue, Kong Kwan, Garrick Miller, Jeremy Belmonte, Gerson.

I found the article intriguing as I was wondering what the Traveling Salesman Problem was as it reminded me of the article that ties time traveling and technology.
In that article that I read, it presents a scenario of a time traveler from the past who travels to modern-day and gets to asks two people
several questions that he has.
What he doesn't know, it that one person is rather intelligent and answering from their mind, 
while the other holds a smart device in their hands to answer the questions.
The time traveler was fascinating to the voice that answered every question correctly, yet does not know that it was not a person answering,
but a person on a machine.

Hence, that article was questioning whether the technology was making us more intelligent and whether we are becoming more reliant to it.

Therefore, when reading this article that included a salesman and more about AI,
I guessed that maybe the traveling Salesman Problem must be related to how someone travels with measuring technology. 

After reading through the commented-out sections of what seems to be code that is displayed to the left, I started to notice more of a dialogue
of humans relationship to the rise of existing and emerging technology.

There was also a strong stance on how we should be more mindful of the role of AI in our everyday lives and media consumption. 
Particularly in Youtube's Algorithm.

I also found it fascinating how the code of the article changes when refreshed. As Andre Blanton mentioned; The essay is the code and the code is the essay.
Is the purpose of having the code displayed as the article play a point in the role of technology or was it used to help explain the concepts in the article
in the language of technology and AI? 

There seem to be formulas used to present code to the side as the essay explains each scenario of technology as well as informing the reader
how The Traveling Salesman Problem is unsolvable with a high $1,000,000 prize from the Clay Mathematics Institute. I enjoyed how the article also explains how
the systems of each company worked and explaining the four scenarios (Virtual worlds, Mirror Worlds, Augmented reality, Lifelogging/) of how 
technology AI and machines are diffused into our lives.

Although I am rather aware of there algorithms almost in everything we do regarding technology, this essay is a wake-up or a reminder that we must continue having 
discussion of the roles of technology in everyday living.
