Interview: Game Girlz 

Geri Wittig on Jul 16 1999


I feel like I got lucky when I stumbled across this article, just because it revolved around my interests and it was not too difficult to understand. It’s an interview with Vangie “Aurora” Beal, who was the director of the site GameGirlz. The site is long gone, but I was able to get a peek of it using the Way Back Machine (thank you, Andrew). The site was an online gaming resource catered to women, meant to be more inclusive and considerate—none of that demeaning language and imagery often found in online gaming forums run by men, at the time. 

While reading the article, I constantly had to remind myself that this is from 1999. And it frustrated me. It’s upsetting how some of the issues mentioned in the interview are still issues today, as if nothing’s changed in the last 20 years. Beal talks a little about the meaning of feminism and how equality is its underlying goal, a simple point that so many people seem to miss nowadays. It’s as if everyone thinks feminism is about creating a matriarchal world, which isn’t the case. It’s about leveling the playing field between men and women and having neither a patriarchal nor matriarchal world but a balanced one. 

I was born in ’97 so it’s not easy picturing online gaming at the time. All that really comes to mind are those early PC games I used to play as a kid, like Freddi Fish and My Little Pony Friendship Gardens, which didn’t really require me to be online. Runescape may be a better example, along with more recent games like Overwatch. 

Beal brought up that there were developers that wanted to gather the interest of female players and that there were even some women who worked in the industry. Again, it’s frustrating that some of these things haven’t changed much in the last 20 years. What surprised me the most is that many of the women who worked in the industry preferred to keep the fact that they were women away from the public. They were afraid of what others would think! That’s just wild to me because if I were in their shoes, I think I would be pretty dang proud. A part of me wants to say, ‘Okay, I get it. Those were different times and it was a very bold thing to be doing…’ but it wasn’t that long ago! I would’ve wanted those women to be proud and set an example. Keep the ball rolling and inspire other girls to push boundaries and pursue a career in the gaming industry.

Beal was asked if they ever felt like a man when playing Quake, which I assumed was a male dominated game. She said she didn’t think in terms of gender when playing games, but that she feels it’s a “womanly experience” when she plays with other women. I get that. I’ve witnessed situations where gender doesn’t matter until it’s found out that a player is a girl. Usually things tend to go bad from there and lots of misogynistic comments are made, which end up ruining what would’ve otherwise been an okay gaming experience. When you’re a woman playing with other women, that’s no longer something you have to face. It's a bit empowering.
