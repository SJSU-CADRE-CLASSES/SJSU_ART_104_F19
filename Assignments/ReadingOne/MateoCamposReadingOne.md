Issue 27: Agency in Videogames

I read through the Agency in Videogames article in Switch Issue 27, since it discussed an aspect of videogames I never really considered and thought about! Whenever I think about the background/context of a videogame, I think of creative, interactive systems, to make a game more presentable, but never in the manner like discussed in the article about empowering the player. Usually, I feel like a player would feel inspired and appreciate how a videogame functions, but never about how they could try and change it. Being a big fan of videogames, Iâ€™d like to take this approach when playing a game next time and try to distinguish interactive and non-interactive elements and see what I can do to fool around with them. I also liked this article to learn about how there are different ideas videogame artists and designers are intrigued in catching the focus of the player, whether they focus on a style of unintended interaction or challenging exploration.
