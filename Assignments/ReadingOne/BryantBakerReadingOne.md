	<p style="margin-left:10%; margin-right:10%;">Shannon Wright was a recent instructor of mine and I found this article interesting because her teaching style seems to be based around the Inspiration and Realization content of her writing. The act of spacing out a set of time to commit to the work with a set of boundaries to guide the creative process is a skill that I need to refine. My own creative process is more of a shot in the dark than the conscious effort she puts into hers, where she calls it the Inspiration and realization process. For art making during her sabbatical she sets out a group of rules that guide her creation. the harsh realitiy that if something doesn’t interest her it won’t get a response form its viewers. The set of rules are inward facing and for the most part don’t rely on how others react to her work but foremost how she will react to it. That is one of the more difficult parts for my creative process, where first I think “what do people expect from me” when she seems to ask the question “what do I expect from myself?” In the reading Shannon never asked that question specifically but phases in Shannon’s Thoughts on the Inspiration Stage reference her own perception of the work heavily even before drafting the piece has started. Moving forward in my own process, this guiding the inspiration stage through heavy inward thinking will ultimately slow but I believe help my process. Here’s hoping. </p>
