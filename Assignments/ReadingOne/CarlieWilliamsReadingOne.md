READING RESPONSE ONE
I read "Agency in Videogames" by Marek Kapolka, in Issue 27 of Switch. It was a very interesteing article regarding the agency of the player within a game. I found it rather interesting that the agency can either add or take wawy from the entire experience of the game itself. For example, if a gamer feels as if they are too restricted by not given enough action then it will feel less fun and motivating to play said game. There are many other examples of either limited agency or a free for all in reagrds to agency. Like when playing a Grand Theft Auto type of game then you can do any sort of action as long as you know how to do it, such as drive a car, airplane, or helicopter if you wanted to. Or there is simpler featured games such as Stardew Vally, while having a creative aspect in unlimited possibilities and choices of farming/income you can perform limited actions regarding those. However, I believe depending on the artistic style of the game itself that the agency for the player can either add a positive or negative experience to one's gameplay experience.
