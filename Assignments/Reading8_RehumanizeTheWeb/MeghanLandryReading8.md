It's interesting to read about the gig economy because through one off character art commissions, microtasks, merchandising, and studies, I've been doing stuff like this for a really long time. I feel like people mean well when they criticize the companies that gig workers are working under, but they haven't really experienced it themselves, so they don't exactly know the appeal, the upsides, and the real downsides.

Generally speaking, it's a marketplace where you can get ahead if you're good at what you do and still have some income if you're not. The flexibility of these jobs are great for students and stay at home parents and people taking on a second job and people with disabilities because they can choose their hours and days that they want to work. 

It is interesting that some companies pretend to have AI when it's really just people behind the machines. And even the ones that do are trained by people.

The AI/human collaboration aspect in the context of art is a nice, optimistic take on automation, and I hope that artists can survive in this way.
