Sebastian Schmiegs Pretend to be a bot, Rehumanize the Web is an interesting take on modern digital labor. Thinking about digital workers being the extension of software is something we see today every day. Whether it’s a door dash delivery or its packing pickup lockers at amazon stores, we are starting to see, digitally mediated labor becomes problematic when they can dispose anyone at any time. It was interesting to read and learn about the different levels of exploitation through some of these services. During the last election, one of my friends moved to Sacramento from New Jersey to work for a voting “gig” and he was getting paid quiet well. When I had found out that he uses other peoples facebook to create pro-trump groups for an exchange of $100, I was concerned about where this money was coming from. His ads were posted on Facebook marketplace and craigslist, offering $100 to remotely create ads on their facebook and to put in there code. He was making hundreds a week and fell under some stress when those facebook accounts got banned from creating or posting in any groups again. I realized that this was the catch, and he was constantly ignoring phone calls from the people he has taken from. When I think of what these services can be used for, I can see it reach dark moral areas that is fueled by the idea of virtual currency. My friends gig only lasted about two months, and he was disposed of without warning or email. Whenever I create a post on instagram, I am contributing to the sharing economy. A majority of the technology we use today is only mining our data, needing us to extend ourselves to be at the service of our digital employer. The macro level of ASI doesn’t rely on humans to pick up half of the work, or to use the human as a extension of the software.
