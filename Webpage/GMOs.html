    <h3>The earth’s freshwater supply is dwindling. Animals are dying. The human population keeps increasing. All of these things paint a grim picture for the future of humanity. As each day passes, it is becoming apparent that major changes must be made or we will soon find ourselves on an inhabitable planet. In order to build a more sustainable future, we propose looking towards genetically modified organisms. The rise of GMOs will spark numerous positive changes, including an increase in the number of pollinators in our ecosystem, as well as investment into the sector of eco-friendly materials and architectural designs.</h3>

        <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">GMOs</span></h5>
    <p>Genetically modified organisms have long been a topic of debate. There are many factors to go over when considering the implementation of GMOs into mainstream society. However, there are many factors pointing to genetically modified organisms as the solution to our environmental woes. Past and current tests with GMOs have yielded positive results.</p>
<p>An example of such a result is the ability to ensure food security. GMOs would allow for more efficient food production, both in terms of growth of crops as well as higher levels of nutrition. This would bring stability to developing nations. Another major benefit would be the expansion of biodiversity and biotechnology. The current state of agriculture is leading to desertification. For one, many agricultural techniques strip lands of their richness, thus forcing farmers to find alternative lands to use. Not only does this result in a dwindling amount of land available for crop cultivation, but it also takes away the space and resources that the plants and animals of this planet need to thrive. Moreover, GMOs require less maintenance, which will assist in bringing about a reduction in herbicide and pesticide usage, therefore lowering the planet’s pollution levels. Simultaneously, extra plant life will also help reduce pollution by taking in more CO2 and producing more oxygen.
</p>
<p>Despite this, there are several major points of contention surrounding genetically modified organisms. One of them is determining who would have the right to utilize GMOs. A situation in which this became a problem was when an enhanced strain of rice crops were introduced to farmers in India as a test run by the biotechnology company Monsanto. This GMO contained higher levels of vitamin A, which allowed poor, malnourished folk to more easily obtain nutrition. The experiment was a success, but a number of problems lingered afterwards. Firstly, there was the question of who owned this strain of rice. Businesses would like to patent new seeds and make a profit off of them. However, this would affect the wellbeing of the poverty stricken who depend on these crops for sustenance. It brings up a conflict of ethics that we have yet to properly address, as the interests of the general people versus that of corporations often clash.
</p>
<p>However, genetically modified organisms were put into mainstream use, the types of GMOs that would be utilized would have to be established. The genetically modified organism would vary depending on the usage of it. For instance, a GMO with the intention of providing nutrition should have increased nutritional value. A GMO with the intention of clearing air pollution should be able to take in large amounts of CO2 and produce equally large amounts of oxygen into the atmosphere. However, all ideal GMOs would have the following qualities in common: quick cultivation and efficient reproduction times.

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Bees</span></h5>
<p>Bees and other pollinators play a key role in various ecosystems. We depend upon them in order to pollinate our crops so we have food or materials. The solution to the increasing temperature and climate changes could be bees and genetically modified plants. With the encouragement in population using carpenter bees we could potentially increase our crop yields and our carbon footprint with the assistance of these bees. With the addition of genetically modified plants, carpenter bees would be able to locally pollinate and encourage eco-friendly practices within society. These bees could be a potential solution to humanity’s ever-increasing issue with climate change. </p>
<p>One such project utilizing bees was a project by Whiskey brand Dewar wherein they have the bees build a honeycomb structure via an inverted mold. This uses the bees in such a way that the bees are 3-D, or 3-B printing, printed by the bees themselves. While using the integration of custom design, this project “the 3-B Printing Project provides 80,000 honey bees with a starter blueprint that mimics their natural environment.” Aganetha Dyck is another artist who collaborates with live honeybees in the production of her sculptures. For her sculptural pieces, Dyck “places objects into beehives and allows insects to build honeycomb on the objects, sometimes over the course of years.” </p>

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Green Roof Tiles</span></h5>
<p>Green Roofs have proven to be beneficial additions to urban societies for decades. In addition to benefits such as keeping interiors cooler during warm weather and providing plants help reduce thermal loading, they also have an aesthetically pleasing character to them. Artists such as Andre Heller, designer of Head of The Giant, have proven that natural live materials can produce magnificent art. Head of The Giant is a permanent display that makes up the entrance of the Swarovski Crystal Worlds. The plants make up the humanoid face with water pouring out of its mouth. This art piece successfully combines nature’s flora with the architectural bounds of the building.
</p>
<p>While Head of the Giant may be beautiful, we don't all have the spare money to create our own live artwork at the entrance of our homes. However, we can improve the planet by incorporating green roofs into our urban architectures. If urban communities can agree to implement a type of roofing that can be added on an already existing roof, we can highly improve the air quality in major cities. Traditional roofing tiles are designed to lead rain away from your home, preventing water damage. What if we create a type of roofing tile that instead of leading the rain away, the water is used to feed a self sustaining miniature garden. Perhaps each roofing tile will be able to interlock with each other like a jigsaw puzzle, allowing them to cover any roof, regardless of the size and shape. This means the tiles could be placed not only on a stable surface, but mobile surfaces as well. We can incorporate the GMO plants onto these kind of tile. The top layer of the roof tile can be made of thin organic cloth which embeds the seeds of our genetically modified plants. Similar to Seedsheet, a product that customizes an array of fruits and vegetable seeds onto an organic cloth that would thrive in or outside of your home. These roofing tiles would offer similar options on vegetation that would depend on several factors including: if the roofing tiles would be built onto a mobile surface like cars, trains, busses, etc; if the tiles would be in a fixed surface like houses and buildings which would allow one to grow taller plants; and finally if you want to grow fruits, vegetables, flowers, or other plants. Furthermore, we can use carpenter bees in these tiles to help pollinate whichever plants are embedded. It would need to be a layer made out of wood which would serve as a perfect habitat for a single carpenter bee. In view of the fact that carpenter bees live solitary lives, they would have a wide range of tiles to choose as their homes while keeping a fair distance away from one another.

    <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Environmental Impact / Potential Dangers</span></h5>
<p>Today, our planet faces a simultaneous crisis of overproduction and famine. How are people unable to obtain the food and resources they need when we, at the same time, are forced to throw away produce because it rots before it can be eaten? With this invention, the ability to sustain oneself will be put into the people’s hands. By being able to sustain themselves with both food and oxygen, people will be in far less danger of shortages. These plants can offset the environmental impact that industrial production has on the CO2 ratio of the planet, therefore increasing air quality and livability for those who cultivate these plants.</p>
<p>In addition, by creating a space for safe pollination and growth of bees, we can help to solve the issue of colony collapse disorder that is currently plaguing our insect population. By discouraging the use of pesticides and increasing awareness of dangerous parasites that could harm them, this work seeks to not only develop food and plants, but also to cultivate a healthy environment for them for the future.
</p>
<p>While such an approach has been taken in the past by genetics company Monsanto, our work does not seek to gain a monopoly on production of produce and seed for a country - at the same time, it will not alienate farmers who focus on large-scale production for a living. These plants and housings are designed for individuals who do not have easy access to imported goods.
</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Genetically modified organisms offer a plethora of environmental benefits, such as larger crop yields and faster rate of growth. With the utilization and integration of genetically modified plants, they can branch off to intersect with pollinators and eco-friendly materials and architecture. Our proposal will raise awareness about the benefits of GMOs and green roofs, which will allow us to bring about positive changes. We also acknowledge the potential repercussions of using GMO plants and the usage of materials in the green roofs themselves. This intersection of science and art will lead us into a brighter future.</p>
