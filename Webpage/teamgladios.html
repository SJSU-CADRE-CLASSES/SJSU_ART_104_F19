            <p> Smartphones have attained a quality akin to that of the human brain like a secondary source of data processing. Smartphones have allowed us an easy access to information and its kept the world in constant communication. Communication was and is a form
              of survival for humanity thus it is significant to maintain that ability. Currently, we use smartphones to communicate, so much so that we are technologically dependent on it. Yearly iterations of smartphones have manipulated in us a wanting for something new,
              the fastest and slickest model, rarely do we ever consider the implications of manufacturing smartphones and how it negatively impacts the environment. Our goals are: to look at mobile technology through its physical and its abstract effects, how can we
              improve the current frame work positively for humanity and the environment, look into different ways of how to improve the current structure surrounding smartphones with which require the upmost attention, how to extend the life of smartphones
              to four or more years, and how to create a sustainable product that is environmentally friendly using breakthroughs in material recyclability while emphasizing technological awareness.</p>

            <p>With the increasing amount of mobile technology appearing in recent years, the concern for the future grows as more people participate in the waste epidemic. The technology we use today are harmful in different ways in our society.
              The use of technology can be dated back as far as humans have lived, in which people would adapt to in order to enhance their daily routines. As the years progress, technology will continue evolving in order to make the life of
              humans easier to function meanwhile hosting new ethical and moral. Through the process of creating new technology, we have learned to create new materials and its forms of function. However, the invention of these technologies are
              leading devastating effects to the planet that needs to be fixed. We have become so accustomed to these technological advancements that the problems in today's society are largely due to them. From political voting to the
              environment, there is still a disconnection between technology and responsibility that can be damaging to nature. Technology needs to be created not only to benefit humanity, but to also benefit our environment.
            </p>

            <p>For years artists have been using the beauty of nature for the purpose of their own inspirations to create designs for electronic devices to have a sleek but more natural look. The transformation from the first computer to the
              modern day iPhone are different in design but are equally negative to the environment. The same can be said for almost all things today, from devices to miscellaneous plastics. As our products become more advanced and modern by
              design, we don’t take any steps to make the planet better even though we value its beauty so much. We have tried to find ways to be more eco-friendly, but we haven’t reach hundred percent.
            </p>

            <p>Throughout time, humanity has progressed through technological advances from the simple bone knife to the computers we hold in our hands. These devices are used so much in our daily lives that it feels like an enhancement for us.
              Not having a smartphone now feels like we’re missing something, relying on the information we think we need and keeping in constant contact with the internet. Nowadays our primary devices contain applications that make our lives a
              lot easier, forcing us to reach for our smartphones more often than not. Under what circumstances does often become too often? Too often may look like multiple hours of use in one sitting or a hundred glances every hour. Our
              reliance on information provided by the internet through mobile applications has forced in us a constant need for a smartphone. Almost all applications are reliant on the internet, which constantly intake your data and provide you
              with other commercial opportunities.

            <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">The Negative Effects of Smartphones on the Environment and Humans</span></h5>

            <p>Although the convenience of a smartphone to carry multiple tools is unmatched so to are its components. The production process surrounding these devices require a lot of components that are harmful to the planet and feed into
              limited resources that typically end up in the trash. Lotfi Belkir and Ahmed Almeligi from McMaster University published a paper in the Journal of Cleaner Production where they analyzed the carbon impact of the Information and
              Communication Industry(ICT) from 2010-2020. ICT is all the technologies that are developed to manage information and transfer it from one place to another, to store information and retrieve, calculate, and so forth. Examples
              would be browsing the internet, sending an email, making a video call, etc. Among all devices by 2020, smartphones will be the most damaging devices to the environment than PCs and laptops. 85% of emissions impact comes from
              production. Smartphones chip and motherboard require the most amount of energy because of the precious metals that are mined at a high cost. Smartphones on average have a two year life cycle which increases more production of
              newer models of cellphones. Keeping a smartphone for three years instead of two can reduce carbon footprint. There’s also ICT that commits to the global emissions footprint. They also contribute to CO2 emissions that comes from
              servers and data centers. Every dumb tweet, every facebook refresh, etc. requires a computer to calculate all in the cloud 24/7 servers. The connection to the internet and technologies have these effects on the planet because of
              how much energy it needs to run them.
            </p>

            <p>“For every text message, every phone call, every video you upload or download, there’s a data centre making this happen. Telecommunications networks and data centres consume a lot of energy to serve you and most data centres
              continue to be powered by electricity generated by fossil fuels. It’s the energy consumption we don’t see.”
            </p>

            <p>“Communication and data centres have to go under renewable energy now. The good news is Google and Facebook data centres are going to run on renewable energy. But there needs to be a policy in place so that all data centres
              follow suit. Also, it’s not sustainable to have a two-year subsidized plan for smartphones.”
            </p>

            <h5 class="w3-center w3-padding-64"><span class="w3-tag w3-wide">Sustainable Design</span></h5>

            <p>Companies can start by looking at internal component materials, and try to make them as organic and sustainable as possible to combat the negative effects to the environment. Batteries are an example of how this tech can
              have more greener solutions, which would improve the battery life itself and after. The Journal of Materials Chemistry A states “The increasing concern with respect to the use of traditional inorganic electrode materials on
              resources and environmental issues has strongly inspired scientists to search for green energy electrodes. Organic compounds are potentially sustainable and renewable materials as many of them can be obtained from natural
              products and biomass.” Looking at ways to make components more eco friendly as a priority would increase interest to participate in making the world better. Aside from batteries, circuit boards are in every tech devices and
              should be reanalyzed. Circuit boards are made of thermoset glass, but it isn’t easily recyclable. Three British companies, National Physical Laboratory, In2Tec, and Gwent Electronic Materials have created the reUSE project,
              a development of 90% recyclable and reusable thermoplastic substrate circuit boards. In addition, when the circuit is exposed to water, the components can easily be scraped off and can be reused for new circuits. Authors
              from the 2015 IEEE conference proposed a way of creating circuit boards that utilize an additive process instead of negative, which reduces chemicals, printing procedures, solvents, and etching in printed circuit board
              manufacturing. Prioritizing the environment through newer technological goals creates a space for humans to be more conscious about the long term effects of the materials they choose in their products.
            </p>

            <p>The demand for domestic recycling grows as the world becomes more aware of the effects of greenhouse gases. New plastic is cheaper than recycling plastic which could be problematic because it has become a tool for mass
              multiplicity. Minimizing virgin plastics would be effective at stimulating a society to try to work around these limits. New technology has posed another problem that is happening within the surrounding environment around us
              through misinformation.
            </p>

            <p>Technology and mobile gadgets of today have proved to be a powerful tool of manipulation, suppression, and misinformation. The days of “don’t believe everything you read on the internet” slogans remain to be at a high, with
              media outlets pumping information constantly. Cell Phones have allowed news and information to be distributed way before newscasts or newspapers even get the chance of showcasing their work. Striving to maintain outdated
              practices or ones that have become highly infrequent, such as newspapers, put a hindrance in technological advances. To do away with infrequent or even unnecessary services can enhance humanity not only in minimizing trash
              but to consolidate information in a single platform. A single source for information or rather a single platform that houses all information in an infinitely revisable, upgradeable, and widely shared platform is digital. If
              all information can be made available digitally or online than the need for physical copies of information no longer have to be made, pollution can be minimized, limited resources (e.g. trees) can once again flourish, and
              the space once housing all these physical copies (e.g. libraries) can be reinterpreted. Although, digital devices themselves and the servers that hold all the data also use limited resources, the impact could remain the same
              or increase in usage slightly; in this case it is highly important to create sustainable products.

            <p>The technology we use today have become highly integrated into our lives and our self-being through our personality, our memory, and our identity. Our lives are in constant connection with technology and will continue to be this way so long as we are attached to our
              tech-driven mindset. However, there is a clear disconnection with technology that has been built due to nature. The creation of smartphones have been built using the environment and its resources, smartphones are made to become useful but in doing so it has also become harmful due to its unsustainable production and large amounts of
              components. The production of technology and the creation of its future self is made with little thought to the environment, technology is used in the purpose of consumption for our needs and desires. Since technology is constantly created, it needs to be thoughtfully designed
              to reduce the negative impacts on the environment and  our health. Going forward, sustainable design must be encouraged due to our dependancy on technology. As humanity progresses, technology is iterated upon and it evolves to better humanity's ability to adapt. However, because of the high demand for advanced technology, not much thought is put into creating them, thus harming the environment around them. Technology should be recycled and
              smartphones should have a policy requiring users to update after four years of usage in order to recieve a new smartphone to reduce our carbon footprint. The production of future technology must take into consideration the components that it takes from the
              environment around them in order to continue creating advanced technology without hurting nature.
